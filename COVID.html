            <h3> Dear Class of 2020, </h3>
            <br> 
            <p> On behalf of the Blue & Gold Yearbook team, we would like to provide an update on how our operations have changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We hope that you are staying safe first and foremost, and have been able to keep up to date with all the operational changes of our campus. </p>
            <br>
            <h6> <b> Purchased a book and have taken your senior portrait? </b> </h6>
            <br> 
            <p> Production for the 2019-2020 yearbook is continuing as normal. For students who have purchased this year's yearbook, we are currently expecting distribution to occur as planned in October 2020.  </p>
            <br>
            <h6> <b> Still need to take your senior portrait or purchase your book? </b> </h6>
            <br>
            <p> If you have already taken your senior portrait and would like to pre-order this year's yearbook, click <a href = "https://yearbook.berkeley.edu/PreOrder.html"> here </a>. </p>
            <br>
            <p> We are aware that many of you haven’t been able to take your senior portraits for the 2020 yearbook. In the interest of public health, we have agreed with our partner, Lauren Studios, to discontinue senior portrait sessions for the remainder of the semester. Thus, we are offering the option of scheduling a senior portrait session during the 2020-2021 academic year (your picture will be in the 2021 book) along with a discount on a bundle of the 2020 and 2021 Yearbooks. If you are interested, please schedule a senior portrait session this Fall semester. More detailed instructions on how to sign up will come in the next few months, but for now please fill out this <a href = "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdNYVLa11sMiqu66FmlQs-weh7vH6SSGPJq8NNxBETgAMX42Q/viewform?usp=sf_link"> form </a>(it does not obligate you to anything). </p>
            <br>
            <p> We understand that it is disappointing to be left out of the book of your graduating year, so we are taking grad photo submissions to display in our 2020 Yearbook! Please fill out this <a href = "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeCPlyyVjwkBFkj5abxS7LDmSwEQmDjrkm5qT9XOEOx8VznDA/viewform?usp=sf_link"> form </a> if you are interested in submitting your grad photos. We’d love to feature your grad photos in the yearbook, though all submissions are not guaranteed to be included. </p>
            <br>
            <p> We hope you and your family are staying safe and healthy. Please don’t hesitate to email us with any questions or concerns. </p>
            <br>
            Best,
            <br> <b> Blue & Gold Yearbook </b>
